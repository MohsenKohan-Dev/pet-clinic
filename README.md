# Pet Clinic Application

This Repository is for __my own training__.

contained in this repo has been taken from [Spring Framework 5: Beginner to Guru](https://www.udemy.com/course/spring-framework-5-beginner-to-guru/) course.

[Spring Pet Clinic](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic) is a reference application created by Spring guys.

I've made this application from scratch for my training, and my personal opinions and preferences have been applied to it.
